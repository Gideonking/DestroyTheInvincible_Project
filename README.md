DestroyTheInvincible_Project
============================

Tower Defense Game Built with Unity3D

All assets are released to the public under a CC-By license, You can use the scripts or models or textures for whatever you want,
I just want credit for what I released. 

THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX!
It requires NGUI and the Aron Granberg A* pathfinding libraries to run. To my knowledge I don't have the
rights to distribute them so I cannot include them in this project.
Both of which can be downloaded for free.

I am hoping this project can grow and the game can improve.
